Hi, I'm Leanid (but i prefer Leonid), 

I'm a technologist, born in Belarus and moved to sunny (sometimes not) Italy when I was young, now based in Florence. My work lies at the intersection of Software Engineering, Data, and Human-Centered Technology. I'm in love with Technology, and how it can improve people's lives. 

In the past, I've worked as Consultant in Finance, Pharma and currently working in Airport Operations. The common thread? Solving problems end-to-end. 

My work is also shaped by my background and education. I've studied at Tomsk State University [TUSUR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomsk_State_University_of_Control_Systems_and_Radio-electronics).

If you wish to know more about my career, feel free to browse [my resume](/cv.pdf).
