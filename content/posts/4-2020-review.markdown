Date: 2020-12-31

## 2020: A Year of Challenges and Growth

2020 was, without a doubt, a year to remember. While the world faced unprecedented challenges, it was also a year of significant growth for me as a software engineer. From mastering new technologies to adapting to new ways of working, the journey was anything but ordinary.

## Highlights of My Professional Journey

### Embracing Agile Practices

Early in the year, I transitioned to working in an **agile environment**. Stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning became part of my daily routine. These practices helped streamline teamwork, improve communication, and keep the focus on delivering value.

### Tackling Complex Data Structures

On the technical front, I delved deep into **SpringBoot** and **OracleDB** while working on a CRM project. Managing complex data structures and optimizing large queries pushed me to refine my problem-solving and performance-tuning skills.

### Learning Swift and iOS Development

In March, I began my journey into **iOS development** with **Swift**. From creating simple apps to understanding the intricacies of Apple’s ecosystem, this experience expanded my horizons beyond backend development.

### Side Projects and Experimentation

One of the highlights of the year was releasing **Alexa Runner Pizza**, a custom Alexa skill that allowed users to order pizza by voice. This side project combined my love for coding with my love for pizza (priorities!). It also gave me hands-on experience with AWS Lambda and serverless architectures.

## Lessons Learned in 2020

This year wasn’t just about technical growth; it also taught me valuable lessons about adaptability and perseverance:
- **Adapt to Change**: Whether it’s shifting to remote work or picking up a new programming language, adaptability is key.
- **Continuous Learning**: The tech world never stands still, and staying curious is essential.
- **Balancing Work and Life**: With the lines between home and work blurred, finding balance became more critical than ever.

## Looking Ahead

As the year ends, I’m excited about what lies ahead. My focus for the coming year includes:
- Diving deeper into **Kubernetes** and **DevOps practices**.
- Building more impactful side projects.
- Continuing to grow as a team player and problem solver.
