Title: Joining Sourcesense: First Impressions and Thoughts That I Made a Mistake
Date: 2021-03-25

## A New Beginning with Sourcesense

March 2021 was a time for fresh starts. I joined **Sourcesense** as a **DevOps Engineer**, eager to dive into the world of automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment pipelines. But within the first week, I found myself questioning my decision. Was this the right move? Did I just make a mistake?

## The Excitement of Starting Fresh

Joining a new company is always exciting. There’s the promise of learning, new challenges, and meeting talented colleagues. Sourcesense offered me a chance to work on **automation** using tools like **Ansible** and to explore environments far removed from my previous experiences. It was a shift I had been craving—or so I thought.

## The Reality Check: First Impressions

Here’s the thing about new beginnings: they’re not always smooth. From the start, I realized this wasn’t going to be like my previous roles. Some of the challenges I faced:
- **Small Teams**: Coming from an agile team structure, Sourcesense’s small team setup felt isolating. We were just four people, with one weekly alignment meeting. It was a stark contrast to the fast-paced stand-ups and retrospectives I was used to.
- **Unclear Tasks**: The lack of clearly defined tasks and processes made it hard to stay focused. The work environment felt a bit… old-school.
- **Night Shifts**: Night shifts became an unexpected reality, and let me tell you, they don’t pair well with early morning enthusiasm.

## Second-Guessing My Decision

By the end of the first month, I was having serious doubts. The role wasn’t what I imagined, and the work felt monotonous. Automating environment setups with **Ansible** and handling infrastructure problems was valuable, but it didn’t ignite my passion.

To add to the mix, the lack of team collaboration and structure made me feel like I was floating without a direction.

## Lessons from a Tough Start

Despite the challenges, this experience taught me a few valuable lessons:
- **Adapting to Different Work Styles**: Not every job will have a perfect structure. Sometimes, you have to create your own.
- **The Importance of Alignment**: Clear communication and task definition are critical for productivity, something I missed dearly.
- **Knowing When to Move On**: It’s okay to admit when a role isn’t the right fit. Three months later, I moved on to a role better aligned with my goals.

## Moving Forward

In hindsight, Sourcesense wasn’t a mistake—it was a stepping stone. It gave me clarity about what I wanted in my career and taught me to value work environments where collaboration and structure thrive. Sometimes, the wrong fit helps you understand what the right one looks like.
