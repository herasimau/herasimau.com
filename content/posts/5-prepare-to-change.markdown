1. **Reflecting on Achievements**: I took stock of the projects I’d completed and the skills I’d gained. This helped me recognize my growth and build confidence for the next step.
2. **Building Connections**: Maintaining relationships with colleagues and mentors was important to me. I made sure to express gratitude and keep doors open for future collaboration.
3. **Exploring Opportunities**: I started researching roles that aligned with my evolving interests, particularly in **DevOps** and **cloud infrastructure**.
