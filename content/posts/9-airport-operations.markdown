Title: Seeking Excitement: Transitioning to Spindox @Thales Airports
Date: 2022-01-15

## A New Year, A New Adventure

January 2022 marked the start of a thrilling chapter in my career as I joined **Spindox** to work on a project for **Thales Airports**. After a period of steady but less-than-exciting work, I was ready to dive into something innovative. Aviation technology? Biometric systems? Microservices? Yes, please!

## First Impressions: Thales Airports and the Project

The project, **Face Boarding**, aimed to revolutionize passenger experiences by enabling touchless biometric journeys at airports. The idea was simple yet ambitious: make travel smoother by integrating advanced facial recognition technology into the boarding process.

### My Stack at Spindox
- **Backend**: Quarkus (native), Java
- **Event Processing**: Kafka
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines with containerized services

## Key Challenges and Responsibilities

Joining Spindox wasn’t just about working on cutting-edge tech; it was also about tackling complex, real-world challenges:
1. **Scalable Microservices**: Designing APIs that could handle the heavy data load of a biometric system.
2. **Real-Time Event Processing**: Leveraging Kafka to ensure fast and reliable event streaming for passenger data.
3. **Collaboration Across Teams**: Managing requirements and dependencies with multiple stakeholders, including airports and biometric partners.

## The Excitement of Biometric Innovation

Working on the Face Boarding project was a revelation. The technology itself was fascinating, but what truly stood out was the potential impact. Simplifying airport processes, improving security, and enhancing passenger experience felt like meaningful goals.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Scalability Is Crucial**: When dealing with systems that integrate with airports, scalability isn’t optional—it’s a requirement.
2. **Kafka Is a Game-Changer**: For real-time systems, Kafka’s reliability and performance are unmatched.
3. **Collaboration Drives Success**: Building a system this complex required seamless teamwork across multiple domains.
