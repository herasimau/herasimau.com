title:  Navigating Complex Data Structures with SpringBoot and OracleDB
date:   2020-01-15 

## Navigating Complexity in Enterprise CRM Projects

It’s January 2020. The world is bracing for the impact of a pandemic, and I’m bracing for something equally daunting: complex data structures. I’m working in Florence on a CRM project for a pharmaceutical company. My stack is **SpringBoot**, **OracleDB**, and **big queries**—a classic monolith architecture. The data is interconnected and dynamic, requiring APIs to handle complex relationships efficiently.

## Tackling the Stack: SpringBoot and OracleDB

My day-to-day involves building and optimizing APIs. I use **SpringBoot** for its flexibility and strong ecosystem. JPA repositories are handy for quick setups, but custom queries are often necessary when dealing with performance-critical use cases. OracleDB handles the backend, supporting the large-scale data demands typical in CRM systems.

While dealing with data structures, one challenge is keeping queries efficient. Performance optimization becomes a recurring theme—indexing, profiling queries, and ensuring the database design supports high-speed data retrieval are key tasks.

## Transitioning to Agile Practices

Before this project, I hadn’t worked in an agile environment. Stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning were new but quickly became integral to maintaining team alignment. Agile provides structure, and retrospectives help identify what’s working and what’s not. It’s like debugging a team’s workflow.

## Personal Growth and Side Projects

Amid all this, I release **Alexa Runner Pizza**, a personal project that lets users order pizza using voice commands. It’s a fun dive into Alexa Skill development, AWS Lambda, and serverless architecture. This side project reminds me that stepping out of my usual stack often sparks new ideas and approaches.

## Reflections on January 2020

This month marks a shift in my professional journey. I’m navigating not just complex data structures but also new ways of working, balancing enterprise demands with personal projects, and laying the foundation for future learning.
