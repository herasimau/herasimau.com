Title: Automating Data Backups: Migrating from Salesforce to Heroku
Date: 2021-11-15

## The Challenge: Costly Data Storage on Salesforce

By late 2021, I was working at **InvesTech SPA**, where one of my key responsibilities was optimizing infrastructure costs for a client. Salesforce is powerful, but its storage can get expensive fast. The client’s ever-growing database was driving up costs, and we needed a solution to manage backups efficiently without breaking the bank.

The answer? **Automating data backups** and migrating the data from Salesforce to **Heroku Cloud**. This not only reduced costs but also provided a more scalable solution for long-term data retention.

## Step 1: Designing the Backup Solution

The first step was to design an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. Here’s the breakdown of the process:
1. **Extract**: Pull data from Salesforce using its API.
2. **Transform**: Clean and organize the data into a format suitable for Heroku storage.
3. **Load**: Push the transformed data into a Heroku database.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Java**: For building the ETL logic.
- **Salesforce APIs**: To extract data from the source.
- **PostgreSQL on Heroku**: As the destination database.
- **Heroku Scheduler**: For automating the backup process.

## Step 2: Building the ETL Pipeline

Here’s a simplified example of the ETL logic:

### Extracting Data
```java
SalesforceConnection connection = new SalesforceConnection();
List<DataRecord> records = connection.query("SELECT * FROM LargeDataset");
```

### Transforming Data
```java
List<DataRecord> transformedRecords = records.stream()
    .map(record -> transformRecord(record))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### Loading Data into Heroku
```java
HerokuDatabase herokuDb = new HerokuDatabase();
herokuDb.insert(transformedRecords);
```

The real implementation, of course, involved error handling, logging, and handling API rate limits.

## Step 3: Automating the Process

To ensure backups ran without manual intervention, I used **Heroku Scheduler**. The scheduler triggered the ETL process daily, keeping the backup system up to date. Setting it up was as simple as configuring a cron job in Heroku’s dashboard.

## The Outcome: Reduced Costs and Greater Flexibility

Migrating the data backups to Heroku saved the client significant costs on Salesforce storage. Additionally, the new system provided:
- **Scalability**: Heroku’s PostgreSQL database could handle growing data volumes with ease.
- **Flexibility**: The backup data was now accessible for analytics and reporting.

## Lessons Learned

1. **APIs Are Key**: Salesforce’s API made it possible to pull data programmatically, highlighting the importance of robust integrations.
2. **Automation Saves Time**: Automating repetitive tasks not only improves efficiency but also reduces errors.
3. **Always Optimize**: Infrastructure costs can often be reduced with smarter solutions.
