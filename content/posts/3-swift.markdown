Title: Diving into Swift: My First Steps in iOS Development
Date: 2020-03-15

## A New Adventure: Learning Swift

It’s March 2020, and I’m venturing into uncharted territory: **iOS development**. Coming from a backend-heavy background with Java, stepping into Swift feels like learning a new language (well, literally). My goal? To expand my skill set and explore how mobile apps come to life.

## Setting Up: Xcode and First Impressions

My first step was setting up **Xcode**, Apple’s IDE for iOS development. Let’s just say it wasn’t love at first sight. The interface is powerful but overwhelming for a beginner. However, once I got the hang of the basics, it became clear why Xcode is a favorite among iOS developers.

### A Basic Hello World in Swift

Every learning journey starts with a simple “Hello, World!” program. Here’s mine:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        print("Hello, World!")
    }
}
```

Seeing “Hello, World!” in the Xcode console felt oddly satisfying—like I had taken my first step into a larger world.

## The Swift Language: First Impressions

Swift is a modern language, and it shows. Compared to Java, it feels more concise and expressive. Here are some things that stood out to me:
- **Optionals**: A built-in way to handle `null` values safely. Coming from Java, this felt like a breath of fresh air.
- **Closures**: Swift’s version of lambdas, but with a twist.
- **Playgrounds**: An interactive coding environment that makes experimenting with Swift a breeze.

### Example: Handling Optionals

```swift
var name: String? = "Leonid"
if let unwrappedName = name {
    print("Hello, \(unwrappedName)!")
} else {
    print("No name provided.")
}
```

This pattern of safely unwrapping values is something I wish Java had natively.

## Building My First App

To put my learning into practice, I decided to create a simple app—a to-do list. It’s the quintessential beginner project, but it taught me a lot:
- **Storyboards**: Designing the app’s UI visually in Xcode.
- **View Controllers**: Connecting the UI to logic.
- **Delegates and Data Sources**: Managing table views.

By the end of it, I had a working app where I could add, delete, and mark tasks as done. Not revolutionary, but it was a start!

## Reflections on March 2020

Learning Swift and iOS development has been both challenging and rewarding. It’s a reminder that stepping out of your comfort zone is essential for growth. While I’m still a long way from mastering Swift, these first steps have opened up a world of possibilities.
