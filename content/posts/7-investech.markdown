Title: Leaving Sourcesense After 3 Months and Starting Fresh at InvesTech SPA
Date: 2021-07-15
## Saying Goodbye to Sourcesense

July 2021 marked the end of a brief but impactful chapter in my career. After just three months, I decided to leave **Sourcesense**. While short-lived, the experience was a turning point, helping me realize what I value in a work environment and where I wanted to go next.

Sourcesense had its pros—working on **automation with Ansible** and diving into **infrastructure setups**. But the lack of structure, unclear tasks, and isolating team dynamics left me feeling unfulfilled. By June, it was clear: I needed a change.

## Entering InvestTech SPA

A new opportunity came knocking at **InvesTech SPA**, and I didn’t hesitate to seize it. This time, I joined as a backend developer with a strong focus on **cloud infrastructure** and **streamlining operations**. From day one, the role felt like a better fit.

### Key Responsibilities at InvestTech
- **Designing Infrastructure Solutions**: I worked on **Heroku Cloud** to build scalable and cost-effective environments for clients.
- **Developing Java Applications**: My main project involved creating APIs to facilitate invoice exchanges for partners. This was not groundbreaking work, but it was steady and clear.
- **Data Automation**: One of my significant contributions was automating the data backup process, transferring data from Salesforce databases to Heroku infrastructure using ETL pipelines. This cut down costs and improved efficiency.

## First Impressions at InvestTech

Compared to Sourcesense, InvestTech had a more structured environment. While the work wasn’t always thrilling, the clarity of tasks and well-defined processes were a breath of fresh air. I also had the chance to meet some great people, including **Pierpaolo DiDato** and others, who made the experience enjoyable.

## Lessons Learned

This period taught me several lessons about career growth and decision-making:
1. **Trust Your Instincts**: If a role feels off, don’t ignore that feeling. It’s better to make a change than to stay stuck.
2. **Value Clarity**: A structured environment can make all the difference in productivity and satisfaction.
3. **Every Role Adds Value**: Even if the work feels mundane, there’s always something to learn—whether it’s technical skills or interpersonal connections.
